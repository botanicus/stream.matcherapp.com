h1. Setup

<pre>
  rabbitmqctl add_user matcherapp.com ae28cd87adb5c385117f89e9bd452d18
  rabbitmqctl add_vhost matcherapp.com

  # Give full access to configure, write and read the virtual host to the user.
  rabbitmqctl set_permissions -p matcherapp.com matcherapp.com ".*" ".*" ".*"
</pre>

h1. Inspect RabbitMQ

"RabbitMQ Management plugin":http://localhost:15672/

h1. Making Sure It Works

<pre>
[T#1] echo -ne "\033]0;Logs\007"
[T#1] ./bin/loggingd.development.sh

[T#2] rerun ./app.rb -sv
[T#2] echo -ne "\033]0;SSE (simulating browser)\007"
[T#2] curl http://localhost:9000/ -v

[T#3] echo -ne "\033]0;Duplicated Event Queue\007"
[T#3] ./bin/inspect.rb

[T#4] ./bin/send.rb 'Hello World!'
[T#4] ./bin/send.rb 'Hello Again!'
</pre>

Now you should get both messages in the @./bin/inspect.rb@ as well as in the curl window. That means everything works.
